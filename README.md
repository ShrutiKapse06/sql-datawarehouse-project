# sql-datawarehouse-project
Built a Modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server, includes ETL and Analytics.

🏗️ SQL Server Data Warehouse Project
This project demonstrates the construction of a modern Data Warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server. It encompasses the full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and analytics, following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). The implementation draws inspiration from Baraa Khatib Salkini's comprehensive tutorials on data warehousing.

📁 Project Structure
Bronze Layer: Extracted and loaded CRM and ERP data from two CSV files into staging tables as part of the ETL pipeline.

Silver Layer: Creation of Integration Model, data cleansing, transformation, and normalization.

Gold Layer: Business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Database: Microsoft SQL Server

ETL Tools: T-SQL scripts and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

Data Sources: CSV files

Analytics: SQL-based reports and dashboards


🎯 Objectives
Implement a structured ETL pipeline using T-SQL and SSIS.

Establish a layered approach (Bronze, Silver, Gold) for data processing.

Optimize storage and performance using views and indexing strategies.

Provide a scalable data model for analytics and reporting.
