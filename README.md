# sql-datawarehouse-project
Built a Modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server, includes ETL and Analytics.
🏗️ SQL Server Data Warehouse Project
This project demonstrates the construction of a modern Data Warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server. It encompasses the full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and analytics, following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). The implementation draws inspiration from Baraa Khatib Salkini's comprehensive tutorials on data warehousing.
